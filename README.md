A markov chain bogus science questions generator and quiz interface based of the Allen Institute science questions dataset. It's a web application built in Python and Purescript.

[Originally written](https://github.com/joelgrus/science-questions) in Purescript Pux, my aim is to refactor the project to use current Purescript and Halogen.
